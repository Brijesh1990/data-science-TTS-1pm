what is Data ?
 Data is a singular form of Datum 
 Data is generated from latin word datum and it meanse something given.
 Data is collection of Text | symbol | images and videos i.e called data

 Types of data :  
 a) structured data 
    structured data is denoted in form of row and columns i.e called structured data 

    examples : Excel | CSV (comma separated value) , Tables

 b) unstructured data 

   unstructured data is not denoted by row and columns i.e called unstructured data 

    examples : text | images | audio etc

what is data science ?
 Data science are form of libraries | framework | packages and data in form of text | images and data there we used data science.

 or 

 Data science is about to data gathering, analysis and decision making there we used data science.

 or 

 Data science is finding data patterns and data analysis to make future prediction there we used data science

 or 

 Data Science is a combination of multiple disciplines  that uses statistics, data analysis, and machine learning to analyze data and to extract knowledge and insights from it.


 By using Data Science, companies are able to make:

1) Better decisions (should we choose A or B)
2) Predictive analysis (what will happen next?)
3) Pattern discoveries (find pattern, or maybe hidden information in the data)


where we used data science  ?

1) Consumer goods (B to C)
2) Stock markets
3) Industry
4) Politics
5) Logistic companies
6) E-commerce

How Does a Data Scientist Work ?

A Data Scientist requires expertise in several backgrounds: 

1) Machine Learning
2) Statistics
3) Programming (Python or R)
4) Mathematics
5) Databases (mysql, sqlite, mongodb)
6) sql
7) prompt engineering
8) deep learning 


Here is how a Data Scientist works:

1.Ask the right questions - To understand the business problem.

2.Explore and collect data - From database, web logs, customer feedback, etc.

3.Extract the data - Transform the data to a standardized format.

4.Clean the data - Remove erroneous values from the data.

5.Find and replace missing values - Check for missing values and replace them with a suitable value (e.g. an average value).

6.Normalize data - Scale the values in a practical range (e.g. 140 cm is smaller than 1,8 m. However, the number 140 is larger than 1,8. - so scaling is important).

7.Analyze data, find patterns and make future predictions.

8.Represent the result - Present the result with useful insights in a way the "company" can understand.
